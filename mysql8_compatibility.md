## MySQL 8.0 Configuration Recommendations

### Server Configuration (my.cnf/my.ini)
```ini
[mysqld]
# Character set and collation
character-set-server=utf8mb4
collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci

# SQL mode for compatibility
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION

# Authentication plugin
default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password

# Performance and connection settings
max_connections=1000
max_allowed_packet=64M
innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G
innodb_log_file_size=256M

# Binary logging (optional, for replication)
server-id=1
log-bin=mysql-bin
binlog_format=ROW
```

### Client Configuration
```ini
[client]
default-character-set=utf8mb4

[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8mb4
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Install MySQL 8.0+**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mysql-server-8.0 libmysqlclient-dev
   
   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install mysql-server mysql-devel
   
   # Or use MySQL APT repository for latest version
   ```

2. **Secure MySQL Installation**
   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

3. **Create Database and User**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < sql/create/create_user_mysql.sql
   mysql -u root -p < sql/create/create_empty_databases.sql
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you encounter authentication issues with MySQL 8.0:

```sql
-- For compatibility with older clients, you might need:
ALTER USER 'arkania'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
ALTER USER 'arkania'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
ALTER USER 'arkania'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Connection Issues
1. Ensure MySQL service is running
2. Check firewall settings
3. Verify user permissions
4. Check SSL certificate configuration if using SSL

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust `innodb_buffer_pool_size` based on available RAM
- Monitor slow query log for optimization opportunities
- Consider using MySQL 8.0's new features like invisible indexes for testing

## Compatibility Notes
- All previous MySQL 5.x specific code has been updated
- Character encoding is now fully UTF-8 compliant
- SSL connections are preferred but not required
- Reconnection handling has been improved for stability

## Testing
After installation, verify the setup:
1. Test database connection from the application
2. Verify character encoding with Unicode characters
3. Check performance with expected load
4. Test backup and restore procedures
